# codeBaseChildPhysicalAbuse
Code base for research project on risk factors for physical child abuse
This repository gives access to all code used for the pre-registered project on risk factors for severe physical child abuse, see here: https://osf.io/pr2d3/registrations
The code is provided "as is" - it is much easier to read in the Org format using the free program Emacs, but can be opened by any text editor. The code is definitely not optimized as much as possible, but is the result of research efforts by a clinician. It is released for transparency and in the hopes that other individuals using Danish registries or similar data sources can be inspired. Anyone should feel free to copy and use any part they may want to, except to make the code proprietary and, also, as a researcher, I would be grateful if you remember to cite me if you use more than just a few lines. 
The project is heavily dependent on the R package data.table (THANK YOU Matt Dowle and the numerous contributors), and also R packages Geepack, gfoRmula, lubridate and other packages for minor parts of the project. 
Want to discuss, change or do anything else with the code? Feel free to contact me at troelsgk@gmail.com
